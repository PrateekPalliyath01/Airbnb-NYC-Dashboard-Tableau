**#Airbnb NYC Data Analysis Dashboard**

**##Overview**
This project showcases a Tableau Dashboard built using the Airbnb NYC dataset. The dashboard provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market in New York City, visualized through maps, pie charts, text tables, horizontal bars, stacked bars, and treemaps.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, transform data into meaningful insights, and present it through effective data visualization techniques.

**##Aim**
The main aim of this project is to analyze and visualize Airbnb listings in New York City to uncover trends and patterns that can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard helps users:

- Understand the geographic distribution of Airbnb listings
- dentify the most popular neighborhoods and room types
- Analyze the price distribution across different areas
- Explore booking trends and availability by boroughs
  
**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Airbnb's public listing data. It contains information such as:
- Neighborhood
- Room type
- Price
- Minimum nights
- Availability
- Number of reviews

**##Methodology**

The project follows these key steps:

*Data Collection:

The dataset used for this analysis is a CSV file containing detailed information about Airbnb listings in New York City.

*Data Cleaning:

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed for better analysis. Missing values were handled, and irrelevant columns were removed before loading it into Tableau.

*Data Visualization in Tableau:

Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize the data through different types of charts and graphs:

- Maps to visualize the geographic distribution of listings by price and neighborhood.
- Pie Charts to display room type distribution.
- Text Tables to provide summary statistics for different boroughs.
- Horizontal Bar Charts to compare neighborhoods based on the number of listings.
- Stacked Bar Charts to represent the availability of listings based on room types.
- Tree Maps to explore the distribution of listings across different neighborhoods and price ranges.

**##Analysis**:

After creating the visualizations, I analyzed the data to uncover trends and insights related to pricing, availability, room types, and geographic concentration of listings.
